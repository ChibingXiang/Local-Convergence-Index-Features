Reimplementation for the paper with Python 

> Dashtbozorg B, Zhang J, Huang F, et al. Retinal microaneurysms detection using local convergence index features[J]. IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, 2018, 27(7): 3300-3315.

Reimplementation with Python code, the experiment is in progress...

The source code scrips are not available from the authors due to commercial and copyright issues, thus this version of python code **should be used for academic purpose only**.

Welcome interested partners to provide suggestions for code implementation of this paper, please feel free to contact and communicate with me.
